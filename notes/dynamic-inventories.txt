* Specifying an executable file as the inventory is considered a dynamic inventory

* JSON output is expected to be returned to STDOUT from the executable

* The implementation (python, java, C, bash, etc) does not matter as long as the program can run on the control host and behaves as Ansible expects

* The program/script must respond to two possible parameters:
  * --list
  * --host [hostname]

The program script must return JSON in the format Ansible is expecting

* Do not forget to make the file executable:
  * chmod +x dynamic.py

* Using dynamic inventories, you can pull inventory information from the likes of:
  * A cloud provider
  * LDAP
  * Cobbler
  * Other CMDB software

* Some Popular Options
  * AWS EC2
  * Rackspace
  * OpenStack
  * Plenty of documentation available
