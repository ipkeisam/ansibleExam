- Overview
   1 Know how to work with commonly used Ansible modules
   2 Create playbooks to configure systems to a specific state
   3 Use variables to retrieve the results of running commands
   4 Use conditionals to control play execution
   5 Configure error handling
   6 Selectively run specified tasks in playbooks using tags

   1 - Common Modules
   * Core modules to be familiar with:
	* Working with files: copy, archive, unarchive, get_url
 	* user, group
	* ping
	* service
	* yum
   * Lineinfile module
   * htpasswd
   * Shell and command modules
   * Script module
   * Debug module
   * See http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/modules_by_category.html

   2 - Create playbooks to configure systems to a specific state
   * Reviewing plays and playbooks:
	* Plays map a group of host to well-defined roles
	* Playbooks are used to orchestrate more complex activities, such as system or application deployment
   * Brush up on YAML
   * Basic Syntax
   * Idempotency (Capacidade de alterar somente o necess√°rio)
   * Pro tips:
	* Retry
	* Limit
	* Watch out for spaces

   3 - Use variables to retrieve the results of running commands
   * The register keyword
   * May be referenced within the play
   
   4 - Use conditionals to control play execution
   * when
   * with_items
   * with_files
   
   5 - Configure error handling
   * Ignoring acceptable errors
   * Defining failure conditions
   * Defining "Changed"
   * Blocks

   6 - Selectively run specified tasks in playbooks using tags
   * How Ansible uses tags
