1 - Template basics
  * Templates give the ability to provide a skeletal file that can be dinamically completed using variables
  * The most common templates use case is configuration file management
  * Templates are generally used by providing a template file on the ansible control node, and then using the template module within you playbook to deploy the file to a target server or group
  * Templates are processed using the Jinja2 template language 

2 - Template module
  * The template module is used to deploy template files
  * There are two required parameters:
     * src - the template to use (on the ansible control host)
     * dest - where the resulting file should be located (on the target host)
  * A useful optional parameter is 'validate' which requires a sucessful validation command to run against the result file prior to deployment
  * It is also possible to set basic file using the template module


3 - Template file
  * Template files are essentially more than text files
  * Template files are designated with a file extension of .j2
  * Template files have access to the same variables that the play tha calls them does
