* It is possible to control the number of hosts acted upon at once time by Ansible

* The Ansible process will create forks to execute actions in parallel

* By default, the process will only fork 5 times

* The number of forks can be set for a single command using -f flag with either the ansible or ansible-playbook commands.

* The default may be changed in ansible.cfg

* The 'serial' keyword may also confine the number of simultaneous updates within a playbook
